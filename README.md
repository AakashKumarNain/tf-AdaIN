# tf-AdaIN

This is an implementation of [Arbitrary Style Transfer in Real-time with Adaptive Instance Normalization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.06868) in Tensorflow. The original implementation in Torch can be found [here](https://github.com/xunhuang1995/AdaIN-style).

For some early results and how to use, take a look at the [example workbook](https://github.com/jonrei/tf-AdaIN/blob/master/AdaIN_example.ipynb).

Note that this project uses the .t7-files trained for the original implementation, download instructions [exist](https://github.com/xunhuang1995/AdaIN-style/blob/master/models/download_models.sh) in the original implementation repository.
